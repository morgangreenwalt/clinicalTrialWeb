FDA has allowed the use of placebo control in several Phase III clinical trials for adjuvant treatment of melanoma.                                                                                               We do not anticipate FDA will require the use of active control in the near-term for melanoma clinical trials in the adjuvant setting. Ipilimumab is highly toxic and may have a poor benefit-risk profile in the adjuvant setting. GSK 2132231A is only being evaluated in MAGE-A3 antigen positive patients (~ 50% of melanoma patients only).  In any double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, it will not be possible to stop patients from seeking other therapies if they suspect they are not receiving active treatment. However, our vaccine is expected to have a benign safety profile, which would make it difficult for patients to differentiate vaccine from placebo treatment based on adverse events. As such, we do not believe patients seeking alternative therapies will be more predominant in one treatment arm vs. the other. In addition, there are no currently approved treatments in this indication except for interferon alpha-2b, so alternative therapeutic options are limited.”",

    "Clarification / Answer from Polynoma": "POL-103A is a shed antigen vaccine composed of melanoma antigens shed from 3 human melanoma cell lines admixed with alum as an adjuvant. The highest dose tested in early development was 40µg. The sponsor desired to investigate whether a higher dose of the vaccine would elicit an immune response in a higher percentage of patients. In multiple Phase 2 studies the vaccine or a proto-vaccine which contained an additional cell line consistently elicited an immune response in approximately 45-50% of patients. The toxicology and preclinical program was designed to investigate safety and generation of immune response to higher doses. In mice and rats a dose response was observed when higher doses of vaccine were used with no increases in toxicity. The 100µg dose was chosen to be sufficiently higher than 40µg to detect a meaningful difference and still be covered by the safety toxicology studies.

There are other treatments for allergies that can be used instead.  Vaccinations such as tetanus are essentially single injections with boosters over the years to prevent live pathogenic infections and if necessary cannot really be prohibited ethically. \nAnd then there are other types of vaccines such as peptides, immune cells, etc. e.g., for cancer. Basically avoidance of immunotherapy both active and passive is the goal therefore agents (strong agents) that can either stimulate (e.g., interferon) or suppress (e.g., immunomodulators, steroids) the immune system that could additionally stress the immune system and potentially confound the study results (safety or efficacy or both), should be prohibited from use on-study. There are many agents out there - Immunomodulators, immunosuppressants, immunostimulants, immunotherapy/biotherapy under which are different drug classes. Note that everything from vitamins to cancer therapy will affect the immune system but vitamins are not prohibited.",

Also, a data analysis of the time from vaccine administration to the onset of various symptoms in order to determine/distinguish syndrome vs. symptoms would need to be done to provide any concrete guidance. Of note, back pain, GI Sx such as cause, vomiting and diarrhea could also be associated with a vaccine. WE don’t want to miss anything but the PI must use judgment",
